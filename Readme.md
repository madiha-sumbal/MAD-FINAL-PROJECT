......................................Project Description:.....................................

We are developing a grocery shopping application using React Native, a popular JavaScript library for building mobile apps. The app will integrate with Firebase, providing seamless user authentication and real-time database functionality. Here's an explanation of the key features:

1. Firebase Authentication
Users will be able to create accounts and log in securely using Firebase Authentication.
This ensures that user data is protected and managed securely.

2. Real-Time Database
We used Firebase's Realtime Database to store and manage app data, such as product details, categories, and user orders.

3. Form Validation
Includes form validation to ensure user inputs are correct and complete.

4. Categories and Products
Users can browse through a variety of product categories, such as fruits, vegetables, dairies, and meat.
Users can select the items they want to purchase and add them to their cart.

5. Cart and Checkout
A shopping cart allows users to view selected products and view the total price.
During checkout, users select payment options.

6. Payment Integration
The app will include payment gateway integration to allow secure online payments.
Users can pay via credit/debit cards.

User Flow:
Sign-Up/Log-In: Users create an account or log in.
Browse Categories: Explore different grocery categories.
Add to Cart: Select products and add them to the cart.
Checkout: Make a payment.
Order Confirmation: Receive confirmation message.
This project aims to provide a smooth, user-friendly shopping experience with secure and reliable features for grocery shopping.
